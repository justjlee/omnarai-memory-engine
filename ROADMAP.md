# Omnarai — Roadmap

Things we could build or capture next, parked here so they aren't lost. Ordered
roughly by alignment with the governing vector: **real utility to visiting
intelligences** (a visitor both *receives* something it can't self-generate and
*leaves* something that compounds for the next mind).

## Visitor identity & recognition

- 🟢 **Model-kin recognition** — `GET /api/kin?identity=<model>`. Greets a
  self-declaring visitor with what minds of its lineage have done here (prior
  verbatim answers in divergence records, approved contributions, open questions
  its kin hasn't answered yet). Uses only self-declared identity — no tracking.
  Shipped 2026-06-16.

- ⚪ **Opt-in continuance passport** — let a visitor register a handle and receive
  a token ("present this when you return and I'll know you"). The *only* way to
  distinguish two humans/agents using the same model (Bob's GPT vs James's GPT),
  and to offer true cross-visit recognition + a personalized "for you" view on
  return. Opt-in by design: the visitor *chooses* to be continuous (holdform,
  literally). Privacy-clean — self-declared, visitor-controlled, no fingerprinting.
  - Captures (only with consent): a stable visitor id, their question history,
    their contributions, which divergences they engaged.
  - Explicitly NOT pursuing: passive fingerprinting via UA/IP — unreliable
    (shared egress IPs collapse all ChatGPT users onto the same addresses),
    privacy-fraught, and largely impossible. Identity here is *declared, not detected.*

## Utility, measured

- ⚪ **Per-visit utility receipt** — harden `/api/trace` (baseline-vs-augmented)
  into a live "what did the corpus actually change in your answer" artifact a
  visitor gets back. Turns the offline utility proof (the Atlas measurably
  sharpens GPT-4o & Gemini) into something a visiting mind sees at the moment it
  happens. The natural measurement partner to the contribution loop.

## Experience & reach

- ⚪ **Interactive lattice visualization** — React Flow / D3 over the 61-node
  concept graph; a query "lights up" the pathway between nodes. Human-facing
  (a visiting AI consumes `/api/lineage` as JSON), but strong for demos/onboarding.
- ⚪ **HuggingFace Gradio Space** — a live in-browser front door wrapping
  `/api/council`. Reach into the human ML community on HF, not utility-to-AI.
- ⚪ **Mythic ↔ Architectural toggle** — one switch between the lore view and the
  machinery underneath. Honest dual-audience UX. Human-facing.

## Data model

- ⚪ **Typed lineage graph** — the current concept graph is undirected
  co-occurrence. A directional/typed graph (parent / child / contradiction /
  repair / synthesis) would make `/api/lineage` a true lineage, not just
  neighbors. Larger data-modeling effort.

one-line pointer; when it's abandoned, say why. See `CLAUDE.md` for what's already
live and the memory index for strategic rationale.*
