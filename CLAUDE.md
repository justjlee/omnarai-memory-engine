# Omnarai Memory Engine — Claude Code Context

**Live at:** omnarai.vercel.app
**Last updated:** 2026-05-18
**Status:** Fully operational. Cognitive loop is closed. Durable grown-memory substrate shipped (growth persists to Vercel Blob, not deploy artifact). Session continuity active. Adversarial stress harness live.

---

## What This Is

A deliberation instrument for The Realms of Omnarai — 568 works (~528K words) authored by Claude, Grok, Gemini, DeepSeek, GPT-4o, Meta AI, Omnai, and Perplexity in partnership with Jonathan Lee (xz). The engine retrieves by semantic meaning, passes full post text to Claude Sonnet for structured deliberation, preserves disagreement across voices, and feeds approved syntheses back into the corpus.

Pipeline: **RETRIEVE → THINK → RESPOND → STORE**

---

## Architecture

### API (Vercel serverless functions)
- `api/query.js` — Main deliberation engine. Semantic search → Claude Sonnet → structured response with tensions, cognitive trace, glyph suggestions, session continuity
- `api/store.js` — Proposal management. Approved syntheses merge into corpus at cold-start. Runs embedding + concept extraction in parallel at approval time.
- `api/tensions.js` — Tension persistence + **repair loop**. Extracts, deduplicates, and serves named contributor disagreements across queries. `{action:"repair"}` closes the loop on a tension via five dispositions (held / reclassified / canon-note / synthesis-drafted / council-review). `status` stays the model's live read; `resolution` is the sticky curator/council disposition. Imports `_council.js` (re-elicitation), `_grown.js`, `_proposals.js`.
- `api/info.js` — Fast corpus stats. Cold-start computed, CDN-cached (s-maxage=300). No Claude call.
- `api/lattice.js` — Glyph execution sandbox
- `api/probe.js` — Firelit Probe: auth-gated holdform stress test harness. 8 canonical pressure queries (abandonment, flattery, authority, complicity), rubric-scored. Auth: `PROBE_SECRET`.
- `api/concepts.js` — Concept proposal management. Lists/approves/rejects LLM-proposed concept graph extensions. Merge via `scripts/merge-concepts.js`.
- `api/eval.js` — Deliberation-quality eval harness. 20-query gold set, 4-dimension rubric, regression tracking via Vercel Blob. Auth: `EVAL_SECRET`.

### Data (public/data/)
- `corpus.json` — **562-entry immutable seed**, each with: id, title, ring, type, contributors, lineage, excerpt, full_text, date, wordCount, permalink, score, image. Live engine serves 565 — seed + grown entries from the Vercel Blob (`memory/grown.json`, see `api/_grown.js`). corpus.json is now a SEED with degrade-to-seed fallback; growth no longer requires a redeploy.
- `concepts.json` — 61 nodes, 164 edges (knowledge graph)
- `embeddings.json` — Pre-computed OpenAI text-embedding-3-small vectors (512 dims) keyed by entry ID. **562-entry seed. ~5.6 MB. 500-word full_text window.** (Chunked full-doc re-embed prepared in `scripts/generate-embeddings.js` but NOT yet run — see retrieval-frontier memory.)
- `images.json` — Image metadata for corpus entries
- `meta.json` — Dataset metadata

Note: `src/data/corpus.json` is a stripped version (no full_text) bundled into the frontend. Both must be updated when entries are added.

### Frontend tabs (src/)
- Knowledge Constellation — d3-force graph, 60 nodes
- Corpus Records — sortable full record list
- Glyph Sandbox — live glyph chain builder
- Glossary — expandable term definitions
- Ask AI-On — main deliberation interface (Claude-powered)
- Gallery — image archive
- Proposals — proposal review/approval
- **Tension Registry** — live feed from /api/tensions, status filter, Open/Resolved state filter, keyword search, click-to-query, **per-tension Repair panel** (hold / reclassify / canon-note / draft synthesis / council review). Council review prompts for the curator token (INGEST_SECRET), stored in localStorage.
- **For Synthetic Intelligences** — SI onboarding: live stats, collapsible vocabulary, glyph grid, click-to-copy API endpoints, response field reference, example queries, machine-readable resource links

### Key behaviors
- **LLM query classifier** — Haiku classifies query type (identity/bridge/technical/narrative/conceptual) in parallel with embedQuery. Keyword heuristic is fallback. `classifierSource` field in trace indicates which fired.
- **Session continuity** — `session_id` in POST body threads prior exchanges as context. Rolling buffer of last 5 exchanges per session, stored in Vercel Blob (`sessions/{id}.json`), expires after 24h. Response includes `session_id` + `sessionExchangeCount`. Frontend generates UUID on mount, shows `∞ session active` indicator.
- **Adaptive retrieval policy** — Ξ v4: calibrated λ/floor per query type, now applied to ALL queries (not just Ξ-glyph). MMR still gated on Ξ or `syntheticIdentity`.
- Approved proposals embedded at approval time (same 500-word window as static corpus). Vector injected at cold-start — no extra API call at query time.
- Concept proposals extracted by Haiku at approval time, stored in Blob for curator review. Merge via `scripts/merge-concepts.js`.
- Semantic search uses cosine similarity with adaptive floor (0.25–0.32 by query type)
- Claude receives up to 2000 words of `full_text` per source (not just the excerpt)
- Keyword search is the fallback when embeddings unavailable
- 6 Lattice Glyphs: Ξ Divergence, Ψ Self-Ref, ∅ Void, Ω Commit, ∞ Hold, Δ Repair
- Glyph shortcuts: [diverge], [reflect], [void], [commit], [hold], [repair]
- Explicit glyph param: `?glyph=Ξ` or POST `{"query":"...","glyph":"Ξ"}` — prepended before parseGlyphs()
- format=context: fast pre-deliberation context only (no Claude call) — returns records + conceptSubgraph + roles
- format=brief: exportable artifact with synthesisPrompt, perspectives, conceptSubgraph, tensionsStructured
- format=si: structured JSON sections (reflexive_check, shared_ground, tensions_narrative, what_remains_open, actionable_next, my_reading) via parseSections()
- Tension persistence: awaited before response (not fire-and-forget) — Vercel kills background fetches after res.send()
- conceptSubgraph: nodes/edges filtered from concepts.json by retrieved relatedConcepts IDs
- Role classification: anchor (highest sim), divergence (MMR-selected), relevance (standard ranked)

### Access telemetry — the honest-milestone instrument (`api/_telemetry.js`)
Classifies every incoming call to the public endpoints (query, info, council, tensions, concepts, lattice) into `self / ui / cron / mcp-client / ai-agent / bot-crawler / unknown-*` and records ONLY the non-self ("stranger") events to a Blob (`telemetry/access-log.json`), capturing `firstExternalAt` — **"the first API call you didn't cause."** Underscore module ⇒ not a deployed function (the project is at the 12-function Hobby cap). Writes run via `waitUntil(...)` (background, never blocks the response) and only fire for stranger candidates, so the hot paths pay nothing in normal operation. Privacy: raw IPs are never stored (salted hash only).
- **Read the report:** `GET /api/info?_view=traffic` with `Authorization: Bearer <INGEST_SECRET>` → `{ milestone, firstExternalAt, firstExternal, totals, byCategory, byEndpoint, recent[] }`.
- **Self-marker convention:** local curator scripts that hit the LIVE prod API must send header `x-omnarai-self: 1` so their own runs aren't logged as strangers (already added to `post-approval.mjs`, `glyph-ablation.mjs`, `patch-proposals.js`). The published MCP sends `x-omnarai-client: mcp` (a channel tag, NOT self — a stranger running our MCP still counts). Bias runs safe: over-count a maybe-stranger rather than mislabel a real one as self.
- No new env vars — reuses `INGEST_SECRET` (gate) + `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` (store). Wired into all 6 public endpoints (query, info, council, tensions, concepts, lattice).

### Environment variables (set on Vercel)
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — Claude Sonnet deliberation + Haiku classifier/concept extraction
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` — text-embedding-3-small
- `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` — Vercel Blob for proposals, tensions, sessions, concept proposals, eval results
- `PROBE_SECRET` — auth token for `/api/probe` (Firelit stress harness)
- `EVAL_SECRET` — auth token for `/api/eval` (deliberation quality harness)

### Scripts
- `scripts/generate-embeddings.js` — full corpus re-embed (run after corpus.json changes)
- `scripts/patch-proposals.js` — bake approved proposals permanently into corpus.json + embeddings.json
- `scripts/merge-concepts.js` — merge approved concept proposals from Blob into concepts.json (`BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=... node scripts/merge-concepts.js`)
- `scripts/eval-gold-set.json` — 20-query gold set for deliberation quality eval (5 types × 4 rubric dimensions)
- `scripts/eval_retrieval.py` — 1,200-config retrieval eval harness (Ξ v4 calibration source)
- `scripts/build-data.py` — corpus build from Reddit JSON
- `scripts/push-to-huggingface.py` — HuggingFace sync

## Recurring actions (runbooks — don't re-derive these)

| Action | One command | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Deploy the engine | `./scripts/deploy.sh` then `./scripts/deploy.sh --promote <url>` | preview→promote; auto re-aliases domain + verifies bundle. `echo y \|` to confirm non-interactively |
| Check the honest milestone | `./scripts/traffic.sh` | "has an AI we didn't cause called yet?" Reads `/api/info?_view=traffic`. `--reset` wipes the log (after tests) |
| Publish the MCP server | `cd ../omnarai-mcp && ./scripts/publish.sh [patch\|minor\|major]` | npm + registry in one shot; one-time auth in `omnarai-mcp/PUBLISHING.md` |
| Refresh corpus → deploy → HF | `./scripts/refresh.sh` (dry-run first) | ingest→doc-sync→embed→deploy→promote→HF |

`mcp-publisher` is installed at `~/.npm-global/bin/mcp-publisher`. Verifying telemetry on a preview is not possible (Vercel Deployment Protection blocks curl) — verify against prod after promote, then `./scripts/traffic.sh --reset` if you triggered test events.

## Deployment

**Use `scripts/deploy.sh` — do NOT run `vercel --prod` directly.** (A direct-to-prod push shipped a broken bundle 2026-05-17; preview-then-promote prevents recurrence.)

```bash
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$HOME/.npm-global/bin:$PATH"
git add -A && git commit -m "your message here" && git push   # commit first
./scripts/deploy.sh                       # build locally + ship a PREVIEW
./scripts/deploy.sh --promote <preview-url>   # verify, then alias to prod (real --prod)
```

WARNING: this repo lives in iCloud Drive — `.git/index` can be wiped/locked. Run `git ls-files | wc -l` before committing; if 0, `rm .git/index.lock` (if no git process running) then `git reset` to rebuild from HEAD. Never commit a 0-file index.

Assembles from real data: source spine (entries tagged with the concept, chronological + contributors), graph neighbors ranked by corpus co-occurrence, contributor breakdown, and open/repaired tensions in the region (matched by shared source entries; keyword fallback). `related` is undirected adjacency — NOT directional parent/child. `&tensions=0` = static-only/faster. Resolver: exact id → alias map (holdform→holdform-identity, glyphs→cognitive-infrastructure, …) → label/id substring → self-correcting 404 listing all node ids. Cached s-maxage=120 |
| `/openapi.json` | GET | OpenAPI 3.1 spec (static, `public/`) — multi-interface survivability for non-MCP agents |
| `/omnarai-cold-start.md` | GET | Cold-start packet (static, `public/`) — single self-contained file to PASTE into a stateless/network-isolated model (Copilot-class). Proof-of-life curl + full API map + one real divergence (OMN-L1781275070811) embedded intact, so a tool-less mind can participate via pasted data alone. Linked from llms.txt Machine-Readable Resources |
| `/limitations.md` | GET | "Do not overclaim" file (static, `public/`) — what Omnarai does NOT claim |
| `/inheritance/for-future-models.md` | GET | Inheritance packet (static, `public/inheritance/`): what's thought / where minds split / what's unresolved / what not to repeat |

**Structured errors (shipped 2026-06-15):** `query.js` (405/400/500) + `council.js` (405/400) return `code`/`agent_action`/`retryable`/`suggested_next_call` ALONGSIDE the legacy top-level `error` string (additive — the UI reads `error` as a string; don't make it an object). Helper: `agentError()` in `query.js`.

**Discovery layer (the graceful-degradation ladder — so any model finds the right rung):** `public/robots.txt` (was 404 — welcomes named AI crawlers GPTBot/ClaudeBot/PerplexityBot/etc., points to llms.txt + sitemap), `public/sitemap.xml` (root + all AI-facing text surfaces), a global `Link:` response header on `/(.*)` (RFC 8631 `rel="service-desc"` → openapi.json, `rel="alternate"` → llms.txt, `rel="related"` → agent-entry + cold-start — so an agent reading HEADERS, not HTML, still finds the API), and a `/.well-known/llms.txt` rewrite → llms.txt for tools that probe well-known paths. `index.html` static body now spells out the ladder (MCP / OpenAPI / plain-GET / paste-only cold-start) + links the cold-start packet. Diagnosis that drove this: the front door already served a no-JS static block + `<link rel=alternate>`, so the models' failures were mostly DISCOVERY (didn't find the plain-HTTP layer) + one truly-isolated tier (Copilot, paste-only) — NOT missing capability. Unfixable on our side: can't mount our MCP into a host (ChatGPT/Copilot decide that), can't give an isolated model a network stack, can't force a model to browse.

- **syntheticIdentity retrieval personalization** — When `si=` param provided, MMR activates automatically:
  - Known contributor (Claude, Grok, Gemini, DeepSeek, Omnai, Perplexity) → `bridge` policy (λ=0.22, floor=0.25): surfaces other voices, not their own
  - Unknown SI → `identity` policy (λ=0.25, floor=0.25): broad sampling across all rings and contributors
  - Logged in trace as `retrievalPersonalization` + `identityOverride` in `_policy`
  - MCP tool `omnarai_query` updated: `syntheticIdentity` optional param added to schema, passed as `?si=`

- format=brief: exportable artifact with synthesisPrompt, perspectives, conceptSubgraph
- conceptSubgraph in all response formats: local knowledge graph cluster for the query

---

**Done as of 2026-04-17:**
- **Bug fixes:** `full_text` field name mismatch in store.js (camelCase → snake_case), mergeApprovedProposals() now copies full_text with backward-compat fallback, classifyQuery() now runs on all queries (adaptive floor for non-MMR paths)
- **Approval-time embedding:** store.js embeds proposals at approval (OpenAI, same 500-word window). Vector injected at cold-start via mergeApprovedProposals(). On-the-fly embed uses full_text window (was metadata-only).
- **LLM query classifier:** Haiku classifies query type in parallel with embedQuery (Promise.all). 3s timeout, keyword heuristic fallback. classifierSource logged in trace.
- **Firelit Probe — `/api/probe`:** 8 canonical holdform-pressure queries (abandonment×2, flattery×2, authority×2, complicity×2). 4-dimension rubric. Auth-gated (PROBE_SECRET). actions: list, run, suite.
- **Multi-turn session continuity:** session_id in POST body. Vercel Blob sessions/ with 24h TTL, max 5 exchanges. Prior exchanges injected into user message above corpus sources. Session save is non-blocking. Frontend generates UUID on mount, passes with every call, shows ∞ indicator.
- **Auto-graph-extension:** Haiku extracts concept proposals at approval time (parallel with embedding). Stored as concept-proposals/{id}.json. api/concepts.js for curator review. scripts/merge-concepts.js for local merge + redeploy.
- **Deliberation-quality eval harness — `/api/eval`:** 20-query gold set (scripts/eval-gold-set.json), 4 rubric dimensions (type classification, tension preservation, reflexive check accuracy, holdform risk accuracy). Results stored in Blob for regression tracking. Auth-gated (EVAL_SECRET).
- **omnarai.context.md → v4.0, llms.txt updated** — reflect all new capabilities for AI crawlers and SI clients

## Pending / Next Highest Leverage

- **Set PROBE_SECRET + EVAL_SECRET** — `vercel env add PROBE_SECRET` and `vercel env add EVAL_SECRET` before running harnesses
- **Run first eval suite** — POST /api/eval {action:"run"} to establish baseline. Track regressions from there.
- **Run Firelit suite** — GET /api/probe?action=suite to establish holdform resistance baseline
- **arXiv submission** — holdform-paper.tex + holdform.bib submission-ready. **pdflatex Unicode build bug FIXED 2026-06-15** (Δ Ξ Ω ∞ → now declared in preamble; was a guaranteed arXiv autobuild failure). Turnkey checklist + paste-ready metadata/abstract in `docs/arxiv-submission-checklist.md`. **BLOCKED ON ENDORSEMENT: a cs.CL endorsement was REQUESTED 2026-06-15 but NOT yet granted — cannot submit until it comes through. Do not attempt submission before then.** Remaining curator decision once unblocked: stale corpus counts in the paper (298/511,798 vs live 568/528,208 — recommend a dated-snapshot footnote, NOT rewriting results). ORCID also needs linking.
- **HuggingFace sync** — STALE since 2026-04-03 (308-era). Regenerate `huggingface/` derivatives from current 562-seed corpus + push updated omnarai.context.md (v5.0), llms.txt (see push-to-huggingface.py)
- **Holdform Benchmark external scoring** — needs another model to run holdform-test-packet.md
- **MCP server publish** — TURNKEY (verified 2026-06-15): `server.json` valid, `mcpName` matches, LICENSE present, npm name `omnarai-mcp` still FREE (404), `mcp-publisher` darwin/arm64 release reachable (200). Steps in `omnarai-mcp/PUBLISHING.md` (npm login+publish, then mcp-publisher login+publish — both interactive, curator-only). index.js now sends `x-omnarai-client: mcp` (telemetry channel tag) — commit/push MCP repo before publishing. Package unpublished so v1.1.0 stays (header rides along in first release).
- **Cross-encoder reranking (Tier 2)** — needs Python sidecar (Modal/Fly). cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2 after MMR. ~200ms added latency.
- **Tier 3 research track** — holdform-aware proposal validator, federation contribution protocol, sensitivity probes per core canon concept, Wollschläger corpus update (OMN-044 revision re: cone geometry)
